RR.1: ... The copies have to  be produced both in human readable
format (screen visualization, print) and in electronic format
and must be available for verification or reproduction
RR.4: ...any change produce a log entry in the audit log including the old values of the data.
RR.5: ...trail includes...4. Electronic Record original value. 5. Electronic Record final value.
RR.7: ...on demand ...create accurate and complete copies of audit trail in a standard form (ASCII,
RR.9: ...shall prevent all user profiles at any level (including System Administrator) from altering the Audit Trail. (rsyslog to other machine would catch that)
RR.11: ...on demand ... view and to print the Audit Trail

User story:
  1Task: create global user middleware
  2Task: create post-save handler for creating audit trail entry + create Audit Trail model; old+new data; unittests
  3Task: implement human readable diff function
  4Task: optional: rsyslogd scope is sending to (hostname/server/client certificate)
  5Task: maybe s3-url like checksum to see if log is valid

 * if we implement the auditlog 
   * transactions ? as long we only use "request transaction" we should be safe
   * thread safe ? 
   * registration of models we want ?
   * how to implement high level changes
     * eg. submission medicalbla changes , we want 
       * mr. huber changed the submission foo on 1.1.2010 at 12:34
         * insert new medical
         * changed sponsor.name from bla to blu
